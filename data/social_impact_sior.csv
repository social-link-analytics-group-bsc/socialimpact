Summary of the impact
"The EVALUATE project provided a novel blueprint and roadmap for combatting energy poverty in the EU and beyond. It proposed innovative approaches to understand and reduce the negative effects of domestic energy deprivation as a systemic issue. The project raised the public profile of energy poverty, and improved the effectiveness of relevant policies at the EU, member state and local level. For his efforts to combat European energy poverty EVALUATE’s PI (Stefan Bouzarovski) was named one of the 4 ‘ordinary heroes’ from the UK in the 2019 EU protects campaign (bit.ly/2K0PCqx), and EVALUATE was one of 20 EU-funded research projects (among a total of 230) chosen to be presented at the high-level conference on ‘EU Research and Innovation in our daily life’, held in Brussels in November 2018. EVALUATE’s policy impact is demonstrated, inter alia, by the citation of its research outcomes within four key reports published by the European Commission (EC) and European Parliament (EP), in the build-up to a concerted European energy poverty policy (wp.me/P3gnoe-IE). In 2016, EVALUATE’s knowledge transfer led to a novel, high-level decision-support tool for the EC – the EU Energy Poverty Observatory (EPOV, energypoverty.eu). The technical offer to develop EPOV was developed within EVALUATE, under the leadership of its PI and in collaboration with over 100 experts connected to a consortium of 13 businesses, think tanks and advocacy groups from across Europe. Subsequently, EPOV manager and EVALUATE researcher Harriet Thomson was awarded the 2017 UK’s Economic and Research Council’s Celebrating Impact Prize for early career researchers. Through close work with EP members and the EC’s Vulnerable Consumer Working Group (wp.me/P3gnoe-IE), EVALUATE and EPOV were directly linked to the development of new legislative proposals under the auspices of the EU’s Clean Energy Package (CEP). These proposals ____were adopted by the European Parliament in 2018, enshrining energy poverty into European law for the first time in history. As an EC service, EPOV is central to the measurement, monitoring and sharing of best practice on energy poverty under the CEP. EPOV’s focal point is a resource-rich web portal that was launched in 2018 at an event hosted by the EC’s Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič, and featuring a speech by Climate Action & Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete. The event was attended by over 500 stakeholders, and the portal has had over 35,000 unique visitors to date, while receiving extensive media coverage. EPOV is at the heart of the first-ever Horizon 2020 call (LC-SC3-EC-2-2018-2019-2020) dedicated specifically to addressing energy poverty. Alongside the EC, user communities benefiting from EVALUATE and EPOV include national governments, energy regulators and ombudsmen, the media, advocacy groups, grassroots activists, businesses and energy practitioners. Support letters from 21 institutional beneficiaries based in 14 European countries are enclosed together with this application. These user organisations have been reached and engaged thanks to, inter alia, the award applicants’ presentations at more than 100 public events since 2013 – including the PI’s talks at high-profile conferences such as EU Sustainable Energy Week, the EU Week of the Regions and Cities, and the Dublin Citizens’ Energy Forum – as well as decision-maker workshops (in Brussels, Budapest, Bucharest, Prague, Gdansk, Skopje, Athens) attended by over 200 relevant stakeholders; the publication of six policy briefs; and regular media appearances (wp.me/P3gnoe-IE). The ultimate beneficiaries of the research are European citizens struggling to pay their utility bills, or access clean and secure sources of energy. The CEP provisions will eventually become law across the whole of the EU. They contain extensive obligations for government and business to reduce energy poverty by implementing energy efficiency measures and ensuring the fair treatment of vulnerable consumers."

"The adoption of new diagnostic techniques in current clinical practice have been evaluated. Hyperspectral techniques can substitute more invasive techniques to resect tumours, such as those based on the injection of contrast for fluoroscopy or ALA-5, or radio-isotopes for PET. The use of non-invasive techniques has a positive impact on the patient health and ____avoids secondary effects of exogenous substances. Additionally, these techniques can improve surgical procedures, providing additional information that will reduce the probability of erroneous resection of healthy tissue. This will reduce the stress of the surgery, leading to higher confidence and better procedures. Moreover, the techniques to accelerate hyperspectral algorithms can be extrapolated to other massive data processing applications."

"The programme ____helped to improve the allocation of UK aid, which resulted into putting a bigger emphasis on the neediest countries. It also brought particular benefits for the assistance process in the case of India."
"In addition to a source of income, the garden has proved a catalyst of peacemaking in neighborhoods plagued by gang warfare and bitter ethnic divisions. The training of new gardeners is the responsibility of community veterans. In this way, communities build their capacity to provide for themselves, and the need for institutional assistance is minimized. In addition, through the sharing of crops and recipes, barriers are softened and often broken down entirely, bringing a stronger sense of community and cooperation in the areas containing gardens. The ripple effects of CSF's work are numerous and widespread. To name a few: nutrition ____improves; ____neighborhoods become safer; ____women acquire business skills; air becomes cleaner; and money circulates in poor communities. In only six years, 21 agriculture sites, have set up providing income for more than 660 favela residents. CSF's determination to equip communities with the skills necessary to sustain the gardens on their own frees up the team to pursue new projects, adding to the prolific nature of their work."
"WIEGO, in collaboration with Nurturing Uganda (a member of the Ugandan Federation for Alternative Trade), runs a project called Leadership & Business Skills for Women Fair Trade Producers. Thanks to this project, a group of 35 women from Kyebajja Tobona, a rural community in Uganda, have received training on new product development, marketing, account management, and savings and credit groups.
