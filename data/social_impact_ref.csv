The `Walberswick Project': Coastal Defence of World War Two
","Building on the academic research of staff and post-graduates, the `Walberswick Project' began as
a local study, emerging from the general interest in landscape fostered in the UEA School of
History by Professor Tom Williamson, and more specifically from Dr Robert Liddiard's expertise in
medieval fortifications and their physical setting. Such expertise was here refocused on what had
previously been the almost totally neglected Second World War anti-invasion landscapes of East
Anglia. The realization that an entire world of landscape archaeology was ripe for rediscovery, and
that what was true of Suffolk was no less true of the 'Atlantic Wall', stretching from Norway to
Spain, has led via the project's website to the delivery of high-quality academic research to
organisations charged with managing European heritage. The computer technology developed
here has fed into further projects that now span the English Channel and several periods of history.
Successful bids for European Union and National Heritage Lottery funding ___have ensured impact
that is international in scope, with results disseminated via websites, print publications and other

English medieval hospital to have survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, this is the only one
that continues to discharge a charitable function to the present day with its archives and fabric
almost intact. Through the AHRC Knowledge Catalyst Scheme, and in partnership with the
Trustees of the Great Hospital and the Norwich Heritage and Regeneration Trust (HEART), over
&#163;26,800 was raised for the creation of an online resource, complete with video models, to interest
and inform schools, tourists, local history groups and to bring the Hospital's unique attraction to

      significant new impetus since 2011 by a substantial HLF grant, which has
      created new educational materials, guided site visits and online

    Many adverse outcomes, including deaths, have been attributed to alarms.
      Historically, alarms have fallen short of their potential to contribute to

    On the basis of the research in her book Cinesexuality
      (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), Patricia MacCormack gave nine public lectures
      at Treadwell's bookshop in London (2009-2011) to 450 people in total,
      rethinking traditional ideas of gender, identity, feminism and occultism
      in cinema. All nine lectures sold out. She also appeared on 16 DVDs being
      interviewed or as interviewer, explaining and distributing key concepts
      from Cinesexuality that question how we watch as gendered viewers,
      and what licit and illicit paradigms constitute transgression and the
      politics of cinematic pleasure. Impact occurred via:
    1) Increasing public understanding of the relationship between
      image and spectator with reference to identity, alterity and ethics;
    2) Enabling public participation with themes in contemporary
      philosophy that validate multiple subject positions, and encourage social
      inclusion and equality through creative practice in film and other arts,
      as consumers and producers.
